# Agentic DM: Future Enhancements 🛠️

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Deep Memory / Archaeology Tool** 🧠🏛️
    - Implementation: Create a tool (e.g., `lookup_past_session`) that allows the DM to search or read logs from archived session folders.
    - Purpose: Allow the DM to recall minor details from many sessions ago that didn't make it into the current summary or World Info.
- [ ] **Dynamic Player Stats UI** (Optional)
    - A simple web view or dashboard to see the current combat table and party status in real-time.

## Current Focus
- [x] Multi-platform / Multi-tenant campaign support.
- [ ] Manual verification and stress testing of simultaneous play.

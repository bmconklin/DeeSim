(Simplified for demonstration purposes)

## Ability Checks
An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.
The DM sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the check.
Typical DCs:
- Very Easy: 5
- Easy: 10
- Medium: 15
- Hard: 20
- Very Hard: 25
- Nearly Impossible: 30

## Combat
### The Order of Combat
1. Determine surprise.
2. Establish positions.
3. Roll initiative.
4. Take turns.
5. Begin the next round.

### Actions in Combat
- **Attack**: Make a melee or ranged attack.
- **Cast a Spell**: Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action.
- **Dash**: Gain extra movement for the turn.
- **Disengage**: Movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Dodge**: Attacks against you have disadvantage; your DEX saves have advantage.
- **Help**: Give an ally advantage on their next ability check or attack roll.
- **Hide**: Make a Stealth check to become hidden.
- **Ready**: Prepare an action to take later.
- **Search**: Devote your attention to finding something.
- **Use an Object**: Interact with an object.

## Rest
### Short Rest
A period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level.

### Long Rest
A period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.
At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die).
